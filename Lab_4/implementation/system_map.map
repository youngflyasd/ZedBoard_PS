Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    79 out of  13,300    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          229
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            81 out of     229   35%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   9 out of     229    3%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         139 out of     229   60%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              40 out of 106,400    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
